# SDD_2.0model
This repository holds the data and code used to run the neural network (AI2.0) built to analyze the sensorless drive diagnosis dataset hosted on the UCI website.
There are four 'versions' of the program but essentially the program performs the exact same job. The difference is that this job is executed on 4 separate processors. The purpose of training/evaluating this network on four different processors is to compare the run times.
